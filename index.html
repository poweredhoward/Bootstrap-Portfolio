          My name is Matthew Howard, and I am an aspiring Software Developer. I enjoy the process of starting with an idea and ending with a functional product. I just got into coding a couple years ago but didn't really develop an affinity for it until last year when I got my first internship. Since then I started to take coding more seriously, which is the main reason why I enrolled in this bootcamp.
        </p>


        <p>
          I started as a Biology student at Santa Monica College with aspirations to be a Physician's Assistant. While this is still a job I would love to do, but I was discouraged by the amount of schooling I would need to do and the crippling debt I would have as a result. I decided to give programming a try and found that I enjoyed it, so I took a couple of classes in Java. After receiving by Associate degree in computer programming I enrolled in the coding bootcamp at UCLA extension.
        </p>


        <p>
          At the moment I don't have an exact plan or idea of where I want to work, but maybe something in the medical field would be interesting, especially given my initial interest in that field.
